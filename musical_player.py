Creating a full-fledged musical player involves working with audio files and handling various audio functionalities.
While building a complete music player is beyond the scope of a single code snippet, 
We can provide a basic example of a command-line-based music player in Python using the pygame library:

import os
import pygame

def play_music(music_file):
    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.mixer.music.load(music_file)
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

def stop_music():
    pygame.mixer.music.stop()

def main():
    print("Simple Music Player")

    while True:
        print("\n1. Play Music")
        print("2. Stop Music")
        print("3. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2/3): ")

        if choice == '1':
            music_file = input("Enter the path of the music file: ")
            if os.path.exists(music_file):
                play_music(music_file)
            else:
                print("File not found. Please enter a valid path.")
        elif choice == '2':
            stop_music()
        elif choice == '3':
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

    print("Thank you for using the Music Player!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


In this example, we use the pygame library to handle audio playback. Make sure you have installed pygame using pip before running this script:

Copy code
pip install pygame
